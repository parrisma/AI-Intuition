All of the _pb2.py files are generated by protoc - but they are checked in to allow the tests to rin without having to
re-create them. They can be re created from the run_proto_compiler.cmd

However this requires you have python3 or a conda env with protobuf installed and activated.

I am going to create a docker container to run this with the local dir mounted as persistent volume and the
required python env set up internally.
